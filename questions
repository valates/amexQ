Element compounds:

Assume we receive a compound as its element string, e.g. Carbon Dioxide whose chemical notation is CO2 comes in as the string C1O2 where each element is followed by the number of atoms of that element. 

1) Write a class that takes in a string compound and stores a count of how many of each element exist. You may assume the input string is proper and all elements in it are actual elements.

2) Write a method, atomCount(), that returns the number of atoms for the specified element string. 

You only need to support the following elements for the sake of brevity: 
Hydrogen (H): 1
Helium (He): 2
Carbon (C): 6



Ethics:

We are classifying social groups based on 8 classifications:
xenophobic or xenophilic
materialistic or spiritualistic
militaristic or pacifistic
authoritarian or egalitarian

The above list has ethics paired off based on ones that contradict each other. A group cannot be xenophobic AND xenophilic for example. 

A group can be classified with any 1 to 3 of these classifiers.

Write a script that takes the above 8 classification strings and prints all unique classifier strings to console. Do not concern yourself with memory usage. "xenophobic,materialistic,militaristic" and "materialistic,xenophobic,militaristic" are considered the same string and one of them (does not matter which) should not be produced in the final output.
